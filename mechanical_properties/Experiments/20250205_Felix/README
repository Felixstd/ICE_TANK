Those tests were performed on the 2025-02-05.

30 3 point bending tests were perfomed on the ice sheet after the ice breakup experiment.

The ice sheet was broken up into 3 floes os different lengths. 

the first one was 115 cm, the second one 98 ad the third one still attached to the beach is 351 m. 

We made 6 tests per completely separated floe and 18 tests for the floe still attached to the beach that we separated into 
3 different parts (3a, 3b, 3c) 3c is the one closest to the beach. 

We want to see if there is a difference in the estimated flexural strength compared to the 2025-02-04 tests and compared by the location of the tests. 

All of the tests were made with the
